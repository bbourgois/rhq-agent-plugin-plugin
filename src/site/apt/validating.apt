Validating an RHQ Agent Plugin

 When a plugin is loaded by RHQ, it is first run through a plugin validation routine to ensure the integrity of the
 plugin. The <validate> goal applies the same logic to your Agent Plugin build. The following checks
 are made:

  * The plugin descriptor is validated against the descriptor schema.

  * For each resource type:

    * The class specified for the component class is accessible.

    * The component class implements the proper resource component interface (ResourceComponent).

    * For each subsystem specified, the corresponding facet interface is implemented. For instance, if operations are
    specified in the descriptor metadata, the component class is checked to ensure it implements the OperationFacet
    interface.

  * If a discovery class is specified, the validator ensures it is accessible and implements the resource discovery
  interface (ResourceDiscoveryComponent).

* Plugin Execution Sample
