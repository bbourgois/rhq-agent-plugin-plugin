Uploading to a remote RHQ server

 The <rhq-agent-plugin-upload> goal can be used when you need to push your freshly built plugin to a remote RHQ Server
 (integration tests, acceptance tests or production server).

 By default, after the plugin is uploaded, it will trigger a plugin scan on the server. This can be configured with the
 <startScan> attribute.
